Easy to setup FAQ / Help website.

The focus of the project is to make it easy to fork and deploy your own help / FAQ website.

### Goals
- [ ] Provide a fully functional FAQ website.
- [ ] Keep things as simple and secure as possible (static site generation).
- [ ] Allow easy deployment via Self hosted infrastructure, Netlify, AWS, etc.
- [ ] Accessible by default.
- [ ] Works on as many devices as possible.
- [ ] Focus on the content, people want to find answers to their questions asap.
- [ ] Easily add content and make the site your own.

### Approach

Using the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator to allow the most flexibility with templating and content. Where possible will use plain HTML and CSS to allow anyone to quickly grasp the setup and build on top.

Template created using CSS techniques from [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) and [CubeCSS](https://cube.fyi/).
